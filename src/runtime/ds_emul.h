// COM/vtable-based DirectSound guest emulation.
//
// The guest binary only imports 2 DSOUND.dll symbols by ordinal — everything
// else goes through COM vtables, synthesized here: Bridge::shim_trap
// returns a guest VA for a shim, and a table of such VAs IS a vtable. x86 COM
// methods are stdcall with `this` pushed first, so Shim{argc = 1 + nparams,
// stdcall_cleanup = true} with cpu.arg(0) == this covers it — no Bridge
// changes, no hand-written assembly.
//
// D2_SON is armed by default; with D2_SON=0, DirectSoundCreate returns
// DSERR_NODRIVER (0x88780078) instead — no thread, no library, no vtable
// touches guest memory. The 32 trap slots are
// still allocated unconditionally: alloc_trap advances the allocator by a
// fixed 16 bytes per slot, so conditional registration would shift guest
// memory layout between the enabled/disabled paths for reasons unrelated to
// the toggle itself (see shim_trap_existing in bridge.h). Slot allocation
// alone never touches guest memory.
