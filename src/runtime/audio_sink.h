// src/runtime/audio_sink.h — THE AUDIO SINK, swappable.
//
// Guiding idea: separate "how much DirectSound" (the guest COM layer,
// ds_emul.cpp) from "how it comes out" (this file). The mixer only knows a
// `write(pcm, frames)` interface; behind it, three implementations:
//   * wav  — writes a RIFF/WAVE file to the write folder. THE off-console
//            evidence: a file you can listen to on a dev machine.
//   * null — discards samples. The mixer still runs, so playback cursors
//            still advance: this is the leg that measures the guest cost of
//            audio before any DSP work exists.
//   * vita — sceAudioOut (src/platform/vita_audio.cpp), console only.
//
// No sink is OPENED unless D2_SON is armed — on by default; D2_SON=0 keeps
// this file inert.

// mixer falls back to the sink PULLED by the frame tick — so NO thread under
// qemu, exactly what a deterministic proof needs.
//
// The cascade: thread_start tries several (priority, stack) pairs — proven
// first, then smaller stacks, then the highest LEGAL relative priority — and
// LOGS the rc of each rung, plus free memory and host thread count before
// and after. The log therefore says either "AUDIO THREAD STARTED (try N,
// priority X, stack Y)" or "AUDIO THREAD NOT STARTED after N tries — rc:
// [1]=... [2]=...", never a bare "FAILED": without the rcs, several
// hypotheses stay alive with no way to tell them apart.

// the thread is running (including if it already was).

// Reads back a file produced by make_wav_sink and writes a readable verdict
// into `report`. Returns true if the file is a coherent PCM WAV AND carries
// signal: duration > 0, expected frequency, nonzero peak amplitude, not 100%
// silence, no massive clipping. That's exactly what off-console evidence
// needs: "neither silent nor clipped" doesn't show up in a log.
//
// PLUS a spectral measurement, because everything above would also be true
// of WHITE NOISE. `tone_frac` is the share of spectral energy carried by the
// 20 dominant bins of a 512-bin spectrum (1024-point FFT, Hann window,
// averaged over the whole file). White noise spreads its energy: 20/512 ≈
// 4%. Music or speech concentrates it: 40% and up. This check now lives IN
// the binary, so it's replayable and regression-testable.
