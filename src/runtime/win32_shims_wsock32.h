// --- socket-handle table -------------------------------------------------
// A guest Winsock SOCKET is just an opaque uint32_t handle; this table maps
// it to a host fd plus the two bits every Winsock emulation layer needs to
// track per socket (guest-visible blocking mode, and the last connect()
// destination port — generic bookkeeping, not particular to any protocol).

int      wx86_sock_fd(uint32_t h);             // -1 if h is not a live handle
uint16_t wx86_sock_port(uint32_t h);           // 0 if h is not a live handle

void     wx86_sock_erase(uint32_t h);          // no-op if h is not live (mirrors std::map::erase)

// --- networking-enabled gate ---------------------------------------------
// One flag, owned here, read by every network shim (this file's own and
// any shim the embedder still registers) so there is exactly one "is networking
// on" bit instead of two that could drift apart.

// --- small generic helpers, also usable by embedder-side shims ----------
uint32_t wx86_wsa_from_errno(int e);   // POSIX errno -> Winsock error code

// Single canonical "last Winsock error" store (what WSAGetLastError, itself
// registered here, returns). Every socket shim sets it on failure through
// this one setter — one store, not two that could read stale after a call
// that only updates one of them. Shims the embedder still registers itself
// (select, the address helpers) use the same setter.

// Completes a non-blocking ::connect() synchronously: waits (GIL released,
// native scheduler only) up to timeout_ms for the socket to become
// writable, then reads SO_ERROR to tell a real success from a failed
// handshake. Returns 0 on success; -1 on failure or timeout, with a
// Winsock-style code written to *outWsaErr (10060 ETIMEDOUT-style on
// timeout). Callers still make the initial ::connect() call themselves —
// this only owns the generic "wait for it to finish" dance every
// non-blocking Winsock connect() needs.
int wx86_connect_wait(int fd, int timeout_ms, uint32_t* outWsaErr);

// Generic blocking-emulated recv/send core: real Winsock sockets default to
// BLOCKING mode even though this runtime keeps the host fd non-blocking (to
// protect the cooperative scheduler) — recv emulates the wait via a
// GIL-released poll when the guest hasn't asked for non-blocking mode.
// Returns the same shape as POSIX recv/send: >=0 bytes (0 on EOF for recv),
// or -1 with *outWsaErr set. `blocking` is the guest-visible mode (i.e. the
// caller's own !nonblock check on the WsockHandle).
// wait_ms: 0 = Windows policy (block indefinitely, or WSAETIMEDOUT if
// SO_RCVTIMEO was set via setsockopt); > 0 = explicit caller-imposed bound.

// --- generic connect-time route override ---------------------------------
// The moral equivalent of a hosts file entry or an outbound proxy: when set,
// every connect() to a NON-loopback destination is rewritten to this address,
// keeping the requested port. Off (0) unless set. This is a sandboxing /
// offline-testing facility of the socket layer itself — it knows nothing
// about which protocol or which game is running on top of it.
//
// NOTE for embedders: this is a BACKSTOP, not the normal way to point a
// client at a private server. The faithful way is the one a real PC uses —
// configure the client's own server list (its registry keys / .ini) so it
// asks for your host in the first place. See win32_shims_wsock32.cpp.

// --- outbound exit lock: nothing reaches the public internet unless
// explicitly allowed -------------------------------------------------------
// A socket-layer sandbox, as protocol-agnostic as the route above: the only
// question asked is "can this address reach the public internet?". When
// armed, any non-private destination (outside 127/8, 0.0.0.0, 10/8,
// 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 169.254/16, multicast 224/4, and the
// 255.255.255.255 broadcast) is refused with WSAEACCES (10013) on connect
// and sendto, and any datagram from such an address is dropped by recvfrom.
// A refusal touches no host socket: no TCP handshake started, no bytes sent.
//
// Default OFF. The engine has no opinion on its consumer's network policy;
// the embedder arms it and decides when to lift it. The verdict is applied
// AFTER routing, i.e. against the destination actually dialed. The engine
// prints nothing itself — it reports a refusal via WX86_NET_REFUSED to the
// observer, which logs it however it wants.
//
// The declarations themselves live in runtime/net_guard.h, a leaf unit: the
// flag is queried from two layers (here, and name resolution in
// net_nonblock.cpp), and this file alone pulls in the whole bridge and CPU.
// Included here so existing consumers of this header keep the same symbols
// available.

// --- generic socket-layer observer ---------------------------------------
// ONE passive observation point over the whole socket layer. The engine
// reports what happened; it never asks the observer for a decision and never
// changes behaviour based on it. Protocol framing, per-application policy,
// logging and instrumentation all belong to the embedder, which registers a
// single observer and dispatches internally. Nothing here names a protocol,
// a port or a product.
