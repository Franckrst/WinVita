/* src/dynarec86/dyn86_memintrin.h — recognizes the guest CRT's memcpy/memset
 * at translation time and serves them natively, without a trap.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A hook (alternate + trap) round-trips through the dispatcher; for a
 * function as small and as frequently called as memcpy/memset, that round
 * trip can cost more than just letting the guest run its own translated
 * body. So instead of a trap, the translator recognizes the block that
 * BEGINS at the memcpy/memset entry point and emits a direct native call in
 * its place:
 *     mov r1, xESP                  ; guest ESP
 *     bl  dyn86_mi_copy/dyn86_mi_set ; C helper (r0 = emu)
 *     cmp r0, #0
 *     beq <original translated body> ; faithful fallback: nothing was done
 *     ldr xEAX, [xEmu, #regs[_AX]]  ; EAX = dst, written by the helper
 *     <ret_to_epilog>               ; normal dynarec RET
 * No trap, no dispatcher: a direct native call from translated code, just
 * like box86's div32/imul8 helpers.
 *
 * SAFETY / FALLBACK. The helper REFUSES (returns 0, the guest does the work)
 * when:
 *   - the knob isn't armed or the address hasn't been published;
 *   - size > dyn86_mi_maxn (16 MiB);
 *   - source or destination is outside the ARENA ([0, dyn86_mi_span)), when
 *     the arena is known -- the same guard as the shim's arena_check();
 *   - PROFILE mode (2) is active: it measures and always returns 0.
 * Overlap is NOT a refusal case: the guest CRT's memcpy body is the shared
 * memcpy/memmove body (backward branch when dst > src && dst < src+n), i.e.
 * exactly memmove() semantics -- so the native side calls memmove().
 *
 * WHAT THE NATIVE PATH DOES NOT REPRODUCE: the flags and ECX/EDX/ESI/EDI
 * clobbers the guest body leaves behind. cdecl declares those volatile, and
 * every call site is compiler-generated code, so that is safe. Flags are
 * left intact (box86's deferred-flags state stays valid) wherever the guest
 * body would have destroyed them -- more conservative, not less.
 *
 * This recognition scheme only works if every call site is a genuine `call`
 * to the function's first byte: no incoming `jmp` (which would resume
 * mid-block), no jump target inside the body, and no data/indirect
 * reference bypassing it. Verify this by disassembly before relying on it
 * for a new guest binary.

/* ---- MODE 3: INLINE SHORT PATH (D2_MEMINTRIN=3) -----------------------------
 * WHY. Measured on console (patrol bench, 3 control passes, control-to-control
 * spread 1.0%): control 21.09 fps, D2_MEMINTRIN=2 (PLUMBING ONLY) 20.75,
 * D2_MEMINTRIN=1 21.52. The plumbing alone costs 1.6 points while the native
 * work gives back 3.6 -- and the measured size census says why that trade is
 * so bad: over a 4000-frame bench, 3,113,000 of 3,117,552 memcpy calls (99.85%)
 * are SHORTER THAN 64 BYTES, and 1,166,000 of 1,392,765 memset calls (83.7%).
 * A fixed per-call cost of about a hundred cycles dominates a 40-byte copy.
 *
 * WHAT MODE 3 EMITS. For those short calls the translator emits the copy
 * ITSELF, with no call at all: an acceptance test (size < 64, both ends inside
 * the arena, no overlap) then a branch-free "by bits" copy using NEON for the
 * 32/16/8-byte blocks and predicated ARM for the 4/2/1 tail. Anything the test
 * refuses branches to the mode-1 helper call, which is emitted unchanged just
 * before it. Emitted sequence and proofs: dyn86_memfast.h.
 *
 * REGISTERS. The sequence only uses the dynarec's three scratch registers
 * (r1/r2/r3), xEIP (dead at block entry, rewritten by the RET), q0/q1 (the
 * NEON cache is empty at block entry and d0-d15 are caller-saved anyway), and
 * xEAX -- which it writes ONLY after the last refusal branch, so a faithful
 * fallback never touches EAX. No guest register other than EAX is modified,
 * exactly like mode 1. */
