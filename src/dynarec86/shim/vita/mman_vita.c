 * Fix: every thread that may WRITE JIT memory calls this before its first

/* --- BRACKET Close+Open: DEFAULT ON, kill switch D2_VMBRACKET=0 ---------
 * The VitaSDK header doc comment for this function pair is backwards. Two
 * independent primary sources agree with each other, and against the header:
 *   - the reference HENkaku/vitasdk dynarec gist: Open = "set domain to be
 *     writable by user", Close = "set domain back to read-only";
 *   - vita-luajit (hyln9) src/lj_mcode.c, the only real published Vita JIT:
 *       mcode_setprot(..., MCPROT_RX)  -> sceKernelCloseVMDomain()
 *       mcode_setprot(..., MCPROT_RWX) -> sceKernelOpenVMDomain()
 * So Open = RWX (superset), Close = RX: "ldrb OK, then strb faulting at the
 * same byte" is exactly the signature of a closed domain. vita-luajit calls
 * the pair thousands of times -- toggling is the NOMINAL usage; "open once
 * and keep open" (this file's original approach) is the exception.
 *
 * Measured on real hardware: the DACR write permission is scoped to the
 * THREAD, not the process or the core, and Close only disarms its own
 * caller -- so bracketing Close+Open around a write opens no unsafe window
 * for other threads. Armed, this lets the native scheduler run stably;
 * without it, a translating worker thread dies shortly after start.
 *
 * Hence DEFAULT ON (D2_FAMINE convention, see tools/rt_boot.cpp: the
 * variable's ABSENCE means armed; an explicit '0' is the kill switch). The
 * original "open once" mode is kept only as an A/B kill switch on hardware:
 * D2_VMBRACKET=0. Both modes stamp themselves in boot_progress -- never a
 * silent mode change.
 * Neither qemu (no domain) nor Vita3K (HLE returns 0 for every thread)
 * exercise this knob: only real hardware can judge it, which is why this
 * file only compiles for __vita__.
 * A lock around the pair is mandatory: without it, two threads racing
 * (Close/Close/Open/Open) can leave the second Open refused and the first

/* ANTICIPATED growth (D2Vita 0.1.8) -- why this function grew a mode.
 *
 * The 0.1.6 field reports settle the question the degressive ladder below
 * was written for. Eight consoles, builds 0.1.2..0.1.6:
 *   - "segment 1/2 de 16 Mo reserve": 8 reports out of 8, always between
 *     3 s and 13 s of boot;
 *   - "segment 2/2" asked for: ONCE, at 2690 s -- and REFUSED;
 *   - "segment 2/2 ... reserve" (a success): ZERO occurrences, parc-wide.
 * The 32 MiB pool this file's default configuration aims for HAS NEVER
 * EXISTED on a player's console. Every observed session ran on 16 MiB.
 *
 * And the pool does NOT grow without bound. The emitted-ARM curve converges:
 * 2.86 MiB at 13 s, 13.64 MiB at 2055 s, then +0.07/+0.11/+0.09/+0.02 MiB per
 * 150 s window -- a finite hot code set of ~14 MiB reached in ~15 min, then
 * ~0.7 MiB/h of residual drift. So nothing is leaking and there is nothing
 * worth evicting: the pool is simply ~2 MiB too small, and the growth
 * mechanism that would have covered that is correct but FIRES TOO LATE.
 *
 * Too late is measurable, not a figure of speech: the single observed
 * request left at 2690 s, when 5120 KiB were still reported free, and the
 * kernel refused even 2 MiB (sce=0x80024B0B, MEMBLOCK_OVERFLOW = VM address
 * space, not a shortage of bytes). At 13 s there were 7168 KiB free and a
 * 4 MiB segment would have gone through, putting the pool at 20 MiB -- above
 * the 14 MiB the session actually needed, for its whole duration.
 *
 * Hence `eager`: ask while the answer can still be yes.
 *   eager=1  anticipated, triggered by a FILL THRESHOLD (see jitpool_pressure
 *            below, default 50% of the pool), i.e. ~2 min into play, once
 *            boot's own allocations are done and long before the need. A
 *            FLOOR of free user memory is honoured, so this can never starve
 *            what boots after it, and a floor refusal does NOT latch: the
 *            next crossing tries again, and the demand path still can.
 *   eager=0  the historical path: at exhaustion, no floor (desperation beats
 *            policy -- a refused block kills the guest thread), and a kernel
 *            refusal all the way down to 1 MiB latches g_jitseg_refused.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS THE HEAPS: nothing, and that is checkable rather than
 * hopeful. Neither heap draws from the free user memory a JIT segment takes.
 *   - the GUEST heap is a GuestRegion carved inside the arena memblock
 *     (rt_boot.cpp: HEAP_BASE=0x00020000, HEAP_SIZE=0x018E0000 = 25472 KiB,
 *     hard-capped by the module base at 0x01900000). Its size is a
 *     compile-time constant of the port; free user memory never enters into
 *     it. The "HeapAlloc returns NULL for a 4269 KiB glyph atlas" family is
 *     that 25472 KiB ceiling, in a different address space -- taking JIT
 *     memory cannot worsen it, and giving JIT memory back cannot fix it.
 *   - the HOST newlib heap is one fixed block of 38912 KiB
 *     (_newlib_heap_size_user, vita_present.cpp), reserved by the loader
 *     BEFORE main() and therefore already deducted from every "free user"
 *     figure quoted above.
 * The one thing that does compete post-boot is box86's own RW metadata
 * (customMalloc's 64 KiB mmap blocks: one dynablock_t per translated block),
 * and the reports measure it: free user went 7168 KiB -> 5120 KiB over 45
 * min, i.e. ~2 MiB, converging with the block count. That is exactly what
