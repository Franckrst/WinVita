// wants to apply. Everything else lives here.
//
// No indirection is added on the per-frame path: these services are called

// opens and closes the file on every line on purpose, so a line survives a

// ---- Durable progress log ----------------------------------------------------
// On console, printf proves nothing — there's no stdout to read. This log is
// the only window into a screenless boot. It opens, writes, and closes on
// every line so the line survives a hard crash.
//
// The lock is not decorative: without it, two threads doing
// fopen/fprintf/fclose on the same file can corrupt the newlib heap (a
// timestamp's ASCII bytes landing on top of a heap pointer). A boot log that
// can crash the boot it's observing is the worst possible failure mode.

// The path is provided by the port — the only thing it provides. It is a
// constant definition rather than a setter: a log line can fire before any
// initialization point we could pick, and lazy init would pull in
// __cxa_guard_acquire (the class of trap the build script's `nm` guard exists
// to catch). A constant initializer has no ordering and no guard.
//
// The port writes it once, at file scope:
//     extern "C" const char* const wx86_vita_progress_path = "ux0:data/…/x.txt";
//
// Off console, the port defines nothing — see below.
extern "C" const char* const wx86_vita_progress_path;

// These two entry points exist on both targets. Unlike the rest of this file
// (a pure console service, guarded by `#ifdef __vita__` on both the
// declaration and its callers), the log is also called from the engine's
// generic body (bridge, cpu_box86, both schedulers, the mapper), which also
// compiles for the qemu/desktop harness. A console-only declaration would
// leave an unresolved reference there.
//
// Off `__vita__`, vita_host.cpp defines both functions as no-ops instead of
// using a weak symbol:
//   * the generic body links strongly, everywhere, with no null check;
//   * no port needs to provide a symbol off console;
//   * off-console behavior stays silent either way.
// A weak reference to the engine's name was considered and rejected: it would
// keep the same failure mode (a port providing nothing stays silently mute)
// under a different symbol name.

// ---- Real sleep ----------------------------------------------------------
// The monotonic clock is not here: it lives in runtime/host_clock.h
// (wx86_now_us / wx86_now_ms) because it's also meaningful off console. Only
// sleep stays here — it goes through the Sony scheduler.

//   position 0 = presentation, 1 = watchdog, 2 = anti-starvation heartbeat.
// Default "222".
//
// The fourth core: the SDK only defines USER_0/1/2 masks (0x10000/0x20000/
// 0x40000), but the console reports activeCpuMask=0x000f0000 — four active
// user-core bits. Digit `3` requests this core; if the kernel refuses it, the
// rc reports that and nothing changes.

// re-pin itself as its first instruction.

// before the thread starts reads back as 0 once the thread is running. This
// function only expresses intent and publishes its rc; the only reliable
// pinning is self-pinning via wx86_vita_pin_self at thread entry.
//
// `relu`: mask read back after setting, like pin_self. Passing nullptr skips
// the extra sceKernelGetThreadCpuAffinityMask call, so a call site that
